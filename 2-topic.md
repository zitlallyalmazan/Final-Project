# Linked List

## What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link)
to the next node in the list.

## Example: Finding Middle Element in a Linked List

The task is to find the **middle** of the linked list.

* Given a single linked list of N nodes.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1) 

**Input:**
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**
Middle of linked list is 3.

## Problem to Solve:

Write a Python program to create a singly linked list, append some items and iterate through the list.
