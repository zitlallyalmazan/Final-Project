## Arrays

An array is a fundamental data structure available in most programming languages, and
it has a wide range of uses across different algorithms. An array is a linear data 
structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous 
and adjacent memory locations. 

# Pros of Arrays

* Arrays provide direct and efficient access to any element in the collection. Accessing
an element in an array is an O(1) operation, meaning that the time reuqire to access an
element is constant and does not depend on the size of the array.
* Arrays allow for fast data retrieval because the data is stored in contiguous memory locations.
This means that the datacan be accessed quickly and efficiently without the need for complex data
structures or algorithms.
* Arrays are a memory-efficient way of storing data. 
* Arrays can be used to store a wide range of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and even
complex data structures as objects and pointers.
* Arrays are easy to implement and understand, making them an ideal choice for beginners learning computer
programming.
* Compatible with most hardware architectures. Making it a versatile tool for programming in a wide range of enviornments.

# Cons of Arrays

* Arrays have a fixed size that is determined at the time of creation. 
* Allocating a large array can be problematic, particularly in systems with limited memory. If the size of the array is too
large, the system may run out of memory, which can cause the program to crash
*Inserting or deleting an element from an array can be inefficient and time-consuming because all the elements after the insertion
or deletion point must be shifted to accomodate the change.
* If an array is not fully populated, there can be wasted space in the memory allocated for the array. This can be a concern If
memory is limited.
* Arrays have limited support for complex data types such as objects and structures, as the elements of an array must all 
be the same data type.
* The fixed size and limited support for complex data types can make arrays inflexible compared to other
data structures such as linked lists and trees.
