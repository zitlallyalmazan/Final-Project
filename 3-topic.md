# Tree

## What is a Binary Tree Data Structure?

A Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Since each element
in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Binary Tree Representation

A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node (commonly known as the "rooot") of the tree. If
the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL> Each node of a Binary Tree contins the following parts:

1. Data
2. Pointer to the left child
3. Pointer to the right child

## Basic Operation On Binary Tree:

* Inserting an element.
* Removing an element.
* Searching for an element.
* Traversing the tree.

## Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree

* Finding the height of the tree.
* Find the level of a node of the tree.
* Finding the size of the entire tree.
