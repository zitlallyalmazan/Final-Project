# Data Structure Fundamentals Tutorial

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Structure Fundamentals Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer
should understand these basic data structure topics:

* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Arrays

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you 
will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after
you have attempted to solve the problem first.
